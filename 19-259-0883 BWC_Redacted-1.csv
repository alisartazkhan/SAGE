"Officer states ""You're all detained"" at 0:56, ""Not free to go"" at 0:56. A civilian asks ""What's the emergency?"" at 1:07. The officer responds, ""No emergency. It's called trespassing and illegal encampments"" at 1:09. A civilian replies, ""Really?"" at 1:17, and ""I don't even know these guys"" at 1:20. The officer instructs a female civilian, ""You gotta give me your ID"" at 1:30, and then ""Come over here, Miss, come over here"" at 1:37. The officer tells the female, ""Have a seat"" at 1:41, ""You can take it off, it won't hurt your back as much"" at 1:47. The officer asks a male civilian ""Sir, what's your name?"" at 1:51 and directs him to ""Have a seat right there"" at 1:54. Another officer says, ""Hey, watch this, guys! This guy's about to get baton'd!"" at 2:02. Dogs are heard barking from 2:30. The officer states, ""We have an uncooperative subject"" at 2:29 and repeatedly issues commands such as ""Obey officer's commands"" at 2:33, ""Get on your belly!"" at 2:55, ""Get on the ground or I'll hit you again"" at 3:07 and 3:10. The civilian yells, ""You hit my children!"" at 2:49, and later, ""Do not hit my children!"" at 3:00. The civilian also shouts ""I am God!"" at 3:01, 3:15, and 3:25, and repeatedly yells ""Stop it!"" from 3:30. The civilian calls for ""Help me!"" at 3:40. Another civilian speaks in Spanish at 4:23, asking ""Se puede calmar?"" (Can he calm down?), and later, ""Dígale que se calme. No, pero ya no le peguen"" (Tell him to calm down. No, but don't hit him anymore) at 4:34-4:35. The officer says, ""Listen to your friend"" at 4:37.","The audio features distant vehicle traffic, prominent human speech, police commands, and excited dog barking. The distinct sound of batons striking is heard multiple times during the interaction with the civilian. There's also some ambient wind noise.","An officer uses a baton on a male civilian multiple times. The first baton strike is visible at 2:34, followed by another at 2:35. Further strikes occur at 2:48, 2:49, and repeatedly from 2:54 to 2:58 while the civilian is on the ground. Additional strikes are delivered when the civilian attempts to get up at 3:19, and continuously from 3:20 to 3:22, and at 3:28 as the civilian is on the ground. From 3:30 to 3:45, multiple baton strikes are applied as two officers pin and subdue the civilian. Physical contact, takedown, and restraint also occur during this period of engagement.","Initially, civilians are observed peacefully at an encampment. Upon the officer's arrival and declaration of detention, they question the legality of the situation. The male civilian verbally disputes the officer's authority and refuses to comply with commands to get on the ground, leading to physical resistance. He attempts to stand up and does not remain on the ground as commanded. The female civilian appears to offer some initial compliance by moving when asked and inquiring about her backpack, though her full compliance in sitting down is not explicitly shown. A second civilian later attempts to de-escalate the situation by verbally asking officers to stop hitting the male civilian.","The officer employs multiple baton strikes on a civilian who, while verbally and physically resistant, does not appear to be actively attacking the officer. The strikes continue even after the civilian is on the ground and expresses pain, and when another officer is present to assist in subduing him. The civilian is repeatedly struck, including when he attempts to get up and when he is already prone.","The video starts with an officer driving a police vehicle. The officer parks and approaches a homeless encampment under a freeway overpass. The officer informs a group of civilians that they are detained due to trespassing and illegal encampments, requesting their identification. A male civilian questions the legality and is then commanded to sit down. When the civilian verbally protests and does not immediately comply with commands to get on the ground, an officer deploys a baton, striking the civilian multiple times. The civilian cries out in pain, claims he is God, and accuses the officer of hitting his 'children' (possibly referring to nearby dogs). The officer continues to strike the civilian with the baton, even after he is on the ground, and requests assistance from another officer to 'flip him over'. A second officer joins, and additional baton strikes are administered as the civilian is subdued and handcuffed.
