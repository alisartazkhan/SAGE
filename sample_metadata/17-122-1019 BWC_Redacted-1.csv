"At 0:30, an officer shouts 'Hey!'. This is immediately followed by multiple loud gunshots between 0:30-0:36. A person, identified as 'Joseph' by officers, repeatedly cries out 'Oh God' in distress from 0:52-0:58 and states 'He hurt myself' around 1:02. Officers issue commands to Joseph to drop a knife ('Don't grab that knife!' at 1:58, 2:03), crawl towards them ('Crawl towards us' at 1:31, 'Crawl towards that truck' at 2:30, 'Move towards the truck' at 3:33), roll over ('Roll over' at 1:56, 4:28), and stay down ('Stay down, Joseph' at 1:45). An ambulance siren is faintly heard starting around 4:18.",The audio indicates a tense and potentially dangerous situation involving officers and a civilian named Joseph. The sound of multiple gunshots is followed by Joseph's distressed cries and officers' urgent commands for him to comply and move away from a perceived weapon (knife). The presence of an ambulance siren suggests medical assistance is being requested or is en route for Joseph.,"Multiple loud sounds consistent with firearm discharge are heard between 0:30 and 0:36. Officers repeatedly command Joseph not to grab a knife. It is not visually clear if Joseph is struck or injured by the shots, but he is heard in distress stating 'He hurt myself' later in the clip. No physical contact is visually confirmed.","A civilian identified as Joseph is repeatedly commanded by officers to drop a knife, crawl towards them, and roll over. Joseph is heard crying out and expressing that he hurt himself. Visuals are too obscured to confirm specific actions, but officers continue to issue commands for him to move away from a knife, indicating a lack of full compliance or continued perceived threat.","The extreme darkness and severe camera obfuscation prevent a clear visual assessment of the scene during and immediately after the firearm discharges. While Joseph is heard in distress and claiming injury after the shots, the specific circumstances leading to the gunfire and Joseph's subsequent actions regarding a knife are not fully observable. Officers continue to issue commands related to a knife, suggesting a persistent perceived threat. Therefore, there is insufficient visual or audiological information to definitively determine if excessive force occurred.","The video begins with a view from inside a police vehicle at night.
